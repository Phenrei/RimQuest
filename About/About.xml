--- Original Description ---
Adds quest givers to trader groups and caravans. This mod exists for those of us who feel that RimWorld could use a little more direction from time to time, and a good quest is just what we need!

When a trader or caravan arrives, simply right click the character with a green exclamation mark above their head to see what quests are available.

After accepting a quest, it will be available to you on the world map. This version contains vanilla events from RimWorld, but more quests are planned to be added in the future.

Steam is giving me trouble uploading screenshots, today.
I've put a bunch of screenshots at the link below, for you fellower RimWorlder, until Steam decides I can upload my screenshots here.

Thank you, one and all.

Also, a tip of my hat to my most wonderful supporters on Patreon. My goal of full-time modding is getting closer and closer.
