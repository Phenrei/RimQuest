Adds quest givers to trader groups and caravans. This mod exists for those of us who feel that RimWorld could use a little more direction from time to time, and a good quest is just what we need!

When a trader or caravan arrives, simply right click the character with a green exclamation mark above their head to see what quests are available.

After accepting a quest, it will be available to you on the world map. This version contains vanilla events from RimWorld, but more quests are planned to be added in the future.</description>
